DMESG Analyzer
==============

Implement a system log analyzer and classifier for GNU/Linux. In this particular case, a sample log output file is provided.
It's highly recommended to implement this challenge in a Linux-based operating system. This challenge involves a proper struct design choice for the logs classification and storing.


Requirements
------------
- The program must be implemented in the C programming language.
- You program will classify log entries by the `<log_type>:` prefix
- Those log entries that don't follow the `<log_type>:` convention will go to the `General` classification.
- Repeated log classes are not allowed.
- Use the `dmesg-analyzer.c` template
- The solution must use at least 3 of the following system calls:
  - `open()`
  - `read()`
  - `write()`
  - `lseek()`
  - `close()`
- Don't forget to handle errors properly
- You need to follow the output format guidelines.
- Before submitting you code, make sure it's compiling and running correctly.


Sample Execution
----------------
```
./dmesg-analizer -input dmesg.txt -output dmesg_report.txt
```


Sample Expected output file `dmesg_report.txt`
